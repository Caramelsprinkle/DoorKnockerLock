# DoorKnockerLock User's Guide:
## Components
Arduino setup includes:
- 1x Arduino UNO
- 1x Breadboard
- 22x Wires
- 1x button
- 4x different colored LEDs
- 1x Piezo sensor
- 1x Servo motor
- 1x resistor
- 4x 220 Ohm resistors
- 1x 1,000,000 Ohm resistor

## LED Info
Red LED: Lights up for one second when the sequence pattern does not match saved sequence in either timing or knock intensity
Green LED: Lights up for one second when the sequence pattern does match saved sequence
Yellow LED: Lights up briefly whenever a knock is detected
Blue LED: Lights up and stays on when recording a new sequence to be saved. Blinks when listening to knock attempts

## User Instructions
1. Connect computer to Arduino UNO with USB B cable and upload the code
2. Set a new passcode by pressing the button and perform a sequence of knocks within 5 seconds after pressing the button
  2.5 Button can be pressed again to end sequence capture earlier
3. Try knocking the same sequence with the same patterns of intensity and timings
4. Servo will rotate on a successful attempt, and will then 'lock' again after 10 seconds have passed. Otherwise, nothing happens
